# Wajipedia - Empowering Accessibility through Knowledge

**Wajipedia** is an innovative Wikipedia clone developed by **Team Blaze** during the Hackomania 2023 hackathon. This project was led by **Md Murtuza Ali**, who guided his team to create a platform that redefines accessibility in the digital age. Built to meet the challenge posed by IIIT Hyderabad's WikiClub Chair, Wajipedia is more than just a clone—it's a leap forward in making knowledge universally accessible.

## Challenge Overview

The challenge centered on creating a web application that caters to users with disabilities, particularly those with motor and visual impairments, as well as elderly users. The goal was to integrate features that go beyond standard accessibility tools, ensuring that every user, regardless of their physical abilities, can access and benefit from the wealth of information on the platform.

## Key Features

Wajipedia stands out with its blend of thoughtful design and powerful functionality, all geared towards enhancing the user experience for individuals with diverse needs. Here’s what makes Wajipedia unique:

### 1. **Engaging User Interface**
The application opens with an intuitive interface, featuring information about Sundar Pichai. This not only provides users with an immediate insight into the platform's capabilities but also sets a welcoming tone for further exploration.

### 2. **Advanced Search Capabilities**
Wajipedia’s robust search functionality allows users to easily find articles on a wide range of topics. The results are displayed clearly, making it simple for users to delve into the information they seek.

### 3. **Seamless Dynamic Content**
Upon selecting a search result, the main content and associated images are dynamically updated, ensuring a fluid and immersive browsing experience that keeps users engaged.

### 4. **Floating Action Button**
A multifunctional floating button provides quick access to essential features like auto-scrolling and text-to-speech. This button is always within reach, making it easier for users to interact with the content.

### 5. **Auto-Scrolling for Effortless Navigation**
For users with motor impairments or those who prefer a hands-free experience, the auto-scrolling feature is a game-changer. Activated through the floating button, it allows users to effortlessly browse through articles without the need for manual scrolling.

### 6. **Text-to-Speech Integration**
Wajipedia’s text-to-speech feature brings content to life by reading articles aloud. This is particularly beneficial for visually impaired users and those who prefer listening to content rather than reading.

### 7. **Customizable Reading Experience**
Understanding that one size does not fit all, Wajipedia offers extensive customization options. Users can adjust font size, choose their preferred font family, and modify text color to create a reading environment that suits their needs.

## A Collaborative Effort
Wajipedia was driven by the vision of its leader, Md Murtuza Ali, who conceived most of the ideas aimed at making the platform accessible to all and spreading knowledge universally. His focus on features that cater to abled people, such as auto-scrolling, text-to-speech, and customizable text options, formed the core of the project. However, it was the combined effort of Team Blaze that brought these ideas to life. While many of the key concepts were initiated by Md Murtuza Ali, the team members also contributed their own creative ideas and technical expertise. Together, they developed a solution that is both functional and inclusive, demonstrating that accessibility and innovation can indeed go hand in hand. This project is a testament to the power of teamwork, where every member's contribution played a vital role in exceeding the challenge's requirements.
